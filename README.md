# POP3-Proxy-Server

## Overview
POP3 Proxy Server is a multi-threaded application that intermediates communication between an email client and a POP3 server. It listens for connection requests on a predefined TCP port and forwards them to the POP3 server on port 110. The proxy also supports user blocking based on email addresses provided in the `USER` command.

## Features
- ðŸ“¡ **Transparent forwarding** â€“ Relays requests from the client to the server and responses from the server to the client.
- ðŸ”’ **User blocking** â€“ Blocks access for specific users based on their email addresses.
- âš¡ **Multi-threaded processing** â€“ Each connection is handled in a separate thread for efficient performance.
- âœ… **Tested Compatibility** â€“ Works with standard POP3 clients and servers.

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Build the Project
```sh
make client_clean
make client
make proxy_clean
make proxy
```

### 2. Run the Proxy and Client
```sh
./proxy
./client
```

### 3. Start the POP3 Server (BabyPOP3Server)
The POP3 server used for testing was started on a separate computer. Ensure that the proxy is configured to connect to the correct server address.

## Configuration
- The proxy listens for incoming connections on a predefined TCP port.
- Forwarding is done to the POP3 server running on port **110**.
- User blocking is managed via a list of restricted email addresses.
